Build the docker image while in the backend directory:
docker build -t backend . 

Hosting on local port 8000, the file main. It reloads for each change, this is a development way of running the code. In production you would leave --reload out. 
uvicorn main:app --reload

Checking the networks, bridge is docker's default network:
docker inspect bridge 

Check the ip addresses:
ip address show

docker network ls:
The docker networks

Connect docker port 8000 to host port 8000.
We use 8000 because thats what uvicorn publishes to. 
Because docker isolates from host initially.
This is more safe from network perspective (--rm=removes itself after we're done with it) (d=detached/background):
docker run -itd --rm --network app-bridge --name backend -p 8000:8000 backend

create your own docker network (which will be the same as bridge):
Its called user-defined bridge:
docker network create insertnetworknamehere
This allows you to ping containers by name

To access the container using tty:

docker exec -it "container_name" /bin/bash

In case of a port error "Address already in use" :
run lsof (list open files) or use a different port:
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001

working setup:
uvicorn main:app --reload
ngrok http 8000

Host my app on my own ngrok domain:
ngrok http --domain=summary-sunbird-dashing.ngrok-free.app 8000


#Getting audio devices from host
#check if pulseaudio server is running on host
ps aux | grep pulseaudio

add pulseaudio --start to .bashrc for running on boot
