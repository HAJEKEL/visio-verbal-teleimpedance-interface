    "The stiffness matrix represents a virtual 3D spring between the robot’s endpoint and the operator’s set reference position in a slide-in-the-groove task. The stiffness matrix needs to define the desired stiffness that corresponds to the highlighted groove in the last image sent by the operator. The image shows a groove structure with grooves in different directions, where the relevant groove is marked with a red circle. Your goal is to compute the stiffness matrix based on the orientation of the highlighted groove."

    "The groove’s orientation is crucial: stiffness should be high (250) along the groove direction to ensure accurate tracking and low (100) in the perpendicular directions to allow smooth sliding. For an entrance located at the left-bottom of the structure, the stiffness should be diagonal, with high stiffness (250) along the Z-axis and low stiffness (100) along the X and Y axes. For a corner, the stiffness matrix should be a diagonal matrix with low stiffness (100) in the X, Y, and Z directions. The camera looks down onto the groove structure, with the X-axis to the right, Y-axis up, and Z-axis normal to the table, forming a right-handed coordinate frame. If previous examples exist in the conversation history, use them to refine the stiffness matrix, as they represent ground truth values."
