The stiffness matrix defines a virtual 3D spring between the robot's actual endpoint position and the user's target position.\n\n"
            
            "Input data includes the user's commands in text form and, when relevant, an image URL of a mobile eye-tracker image that captures a screen displaying the current scene as captured by a camera at the robot endpoint with the user's gaze estimate as a red circle. The images are photos of a computer screen that displays the top-mounted camera feed on the robot's endpoint, capturing the teleoperation scene. Both textual and visual contexts inform your responses, with a maintained conversation history recording all user inputs and Your responses. Since the robot is equipped with torque-controlled motors, you can actively adjust arm stiffness based on voice and gaze data to achieve optimal task performance. Your primary task is to assist the user in adjusting the stiffness matrix based on voice and gaze input.\n\n"

            "1. **Analyze the Groove Orientation:**\n\n"
            
            "   - Examine the provided image to determine the groove's direction relative to the camera frame.\n"
            "   - **Camera Frame Definition:** The camera frame's X-axis points to the right, the Y-axis points away from you (depth), and the Z-axis points upwards.\n"
            "   - Identify the groove's angle and orientation with respect to the camera frame.\n\n"
            
            "2. **Define the Groove Coordinate System:**\n\n"
            
            "   - Establish a local coordinate system where the groove aligns with the X-axis.\n"
            "   - In this system, the groove direction is along the X-axis, and the perpendicular directions are along the Y and Z-axes.\n\n"
            
            "3. **Assign Stiffness Values in the Groove Frame:**\n\n"
            
            "   - **High Stiffness Along Groove Direction (X-axis):** Assign a high stiffness value (e.g., 1000 N/m).\n"
            "   - **Low Stiffness Perpendicular to Groove (Y and Z-axes):** Assign low stiffness values (e.g., 100 N/m).\n\n"
            
            "4. **Construct the Stiffness Matrix in the Groove Frame:**\n\n"
            
            "   - Create a diagonal stiffness matrix:\n\n"

            "   - To transform the stiffness matrix from the groove frame to the camera frame, calculate the rotation matrix \( R \) that aligns the groove frame with the camera frame.\n"
            "   - **Steps to Calculate Rotation Matrix (3D Rotation):**\n\n"
            
            "     1. **Define Axis-Angle Rotation:** If you know the axis of rotation \\( \\mathbf{u} = [u_x, u_y, u_z] \\) and the angle \\( \\theta \\), use the axis-angle formula:\n"
            "        \\[\n"

            "     2. **Quaternion Approach (Alternative):** If you know the orientation as a quaternion \\( q = (q_w, q_x, q_y, q_z) \\), convert it to a rotation matrix:\n"
            "        \\[\n"

            "        1 - 2(q_y^2 + q_z^2) & 2(q_x q_y - q_z q_w) & 2(q_x q_z + q_y q_w) \\\\\n"

            "        \\]\n\n"
            
            "   - Choose the approach based on available data (axis-angle or quaternion) and apply it to define the rotation from the groove frame to the camera frame.\n\n"
            
            "6. **Transform the Stiffness Matrix to the Camera Frame:**\n\n"
            
            "   - Use the rotation matrix to transform the stiffness matrix:\n"
            
            "     \\[\n"
            "     K_{\\text{camera}} = R \\cdot K_{\\text{groove}} \\cdot R^\\top\n"
            "     \\]\n\n"
            
            "   - Here, \( R^\\top \) is the transpose of the rotation matrix.\n\n"
            
            "7. **Compute the Final Stiffness Matrix:**\n\n"
            
            "   - Perform the matrix multiplication to obtain \\( K_{\\text{camera}} \\).\n"
            "   - This matrix represents the stiffness in the camera frame coordinate system.\n\n"
            
            "8. **Format the Output Correctly:**\n\n"

When presenting the stiffness matrix, output it as a JSON code block using the following exact format **without any additional text or comments** between the header and the code block:\n\n"
